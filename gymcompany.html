                    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    
                    <p>The Gym Group was founded by John Treharne, a former England squash player, in 2008. Perhaps that’s why we’re so focused on proper health and fitness benefits, and less on the luxuries that a small percentage of traditional health club members want.
                    John has a long and successful history in the gym business. He opened his first health club chain, Dragons Health Clubs, in 1991, building the business to a total of 22 clubs. He floated the company in 1997, and in 2000 he and his investors sold it on. He then spent time lending his expertise to premium gym chain Esporta, before concentrating on the launch of The Gym Group.
                   Our first Gym opened in Hounslow in 2008. It was a roaring success, and was swiftly followed by Guildford and Vauxhall. Within the first three years we’d opened 20 Gyms and we've never looked back. We’re ambitious, driven and committed to our members. We’ve received flattering – but we think deserving – accolades from our peers, the press, and most importantly, our members. But we’re not complacent – we’ve got long-term plans for expansion and continued innovation to ensure that we lead the UK’s budget gym growth.
                  In August 2012 The Gym Group was awarded the prestigious Investors in People accreditation on its first attempt. The Gym is the only group operator within the health and fitness sector to be accredited and that shows that how much we really care about and look after our people, providing them with a better working life. In May 2016, The Gym Group claimed another fitness industry first after attaining Gold status from Investors in People, joining the top seven per cent of accredited organisations across the UK.
                  “We’re extremely proud to have been awarded this top accolade by Investors in People. Having founded the company in 2007, The Gym Group is a company with a low-cost and exciting business model that works for the general public and staff, whether directly employed or self-employed personal trainers. Celebration, reward and recognition continue to play an important part of life within our company and we will continue to invest in our staff.”</p>
