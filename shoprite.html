                   <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3> 
                    
                    <p>The Shoprite Group of Companies (JSE: SHP) is Africa's largest supermarket retailer, operating more than 2,892 stores across Africa. The company's headquarters are in Brackenfell in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Shoprite Holdings Limited is a public company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, with secondary listings on both the Namibian and Zambian Stock Exchanges. The Group employs more than 142,000 people and is the biggest private-sector employer in South Africa.
                    Proud beginnings (1979)
                    The Shoprite Group of companies was established in 1979 when a small eight-store Western Cape grocer was purchased from the Rogut family. At this time, Shoprite had fewer than 400 employees and was valued at less than R1 million.
                    Expansion in South Africa (1980-1989)
                    In 1980, the Group established its vision and decided to focus on middle-to-lower income markets and supplement its growth through the acquisition of other supermarkets or groups of supermarkets. By 1983, the 21st Shoprite store was opened and the Group had expanded across South Africa’s Western Cape border by opening an outlet in Hartswater in the Northern Cape.Shoprite Holdings was listed on the JSE Limited in South Africa for the first time in 1986, with a market capitalisation of R29 million. By 1989, it was operating in various South African provinces, including Limpopo.
                    Expansion in Africa (1990-1999)
                    Logically, the next step was to expand into Africa. In 1990 Shoprite opened its first store outside of South Africa, in Windhoek, Namibia, and in 1995 the first store in Lusaka, Zambia, was opened. That same year it acquired a centralised distribution company Sentra, which had been acting as a central buyer for 550 owner-managed supermarkets, thereby allowing Shoprite to expand into franchising.In 1991, it acquired the national Checkers chain and, overnight, the Group’s operations increased to 241 outlets and a staffcomplement of almost 22,600.
                    On 24 December 1996, a bomb exploded in a Worcester Shoprite and killed three people and injured over 50. It was a racially motivated act that shocked the company. But, in showing its appreciation for hard work, the Group launched the Woman of the Year Award to mark National Women's Day, an award that later became South Africa’s premier accolade for achievement by women before coming to an end in 2012.The acquisition of OK Bazaars Group, 1997.
                    In 1997 the struggling "OK Bazaars" was acquired by the company from South African Breweries for one rand, adding 139 OK Bazaars stores and 18 Hyperama branches to the company.</p>
