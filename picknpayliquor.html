                    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    
                    <p>The Pick n Pay Group is a retail business in the fast-moving consumer goods industry. The Group operates through multiple store formats under three brands â€“ Pick n Pay, Boxer and TM Supermarkets. Pick n Pay also operates one of the largest online grocery platforms in sub-Saharan Africa. Raymond Ackerman purchased the first four Pick n Pay stores in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1967. Since then, the Group has grown to encompass stores across South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Nigeria, eSwatini and Lesotho. Pick n Pay also owns a 49% share of Zimbabwean supermarket chain, TM Supermarkets.As of 2021, the company was operating at 1,994 locations across eight countries on the African continent.</p>
                    <p>n early 1967, Ackerman returned to Cape Town and negotiated to acquire four small stores, called Pick 'n Pay, from Jack Goldin (who then founded the Clicks retail group in 1968).</p>
                    <p>Pick 'n Pay opened the doors of its first hypermarket in 1975, smashing all previous sales records. With Pick 'n Pay's rise to the top of South Africa's retail scene in full swing, Ackerman next attempted to expand the company's format into a new market, entering Australia with a highly successful store in Brisbane in the early 1980s.</p>
                    <p>The purchase of four small stores from Jack Goldin was the genesis of what is today a massive retail operation with more than 1700 stores. Ackerman retired as chairperson of Pick n Pay when he turned 80.</p>
                    <p>Founded in 1967 as a family controlled business with four small stores in the Western Cape, Pick n Pay listed on the JSE the following year. Pick n Pay Group is managed through three divisions; each with their own management boards: Pick n Pay Retail Division; the Group Enterprises Division; and Franklins Australia.</p>
